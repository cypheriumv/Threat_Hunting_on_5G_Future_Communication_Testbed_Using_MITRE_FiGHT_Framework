# Threat_Hunting_on_5G_Future_Communication_Testbed_Using_MITRE_FiGHT_Framework

## 1. Introduction
This project is at the forefront of enhancing threat hunting [1] capabilities within 5G networks. Utilizing the comprehensive resources of the MITRE FiGHT scenario mapping, this initiative aims to develop methodologies that detect and mitigate cyber threats in 5G systems. MITRE FiGHT [2] integrates theoretical approaches, proof-of-concept strategies, and observed techniques, providing a robust foundation for identifying potential threats and refining security research tailored to the dynamics of 5G technology and beyond (i.e., 6G).

The scope of this project encompasses executing threat hunting exercises, supported by advanced cybersecurity solutions and intelligence, with the collaboration of industry experts from ITSEC. Our efforts are directed towards conducting in-depth threat assessments, emulating adversary tactics, identifying security vulnerabilities, and producing thorough documentation and analysis. This comprehensive approach aims to reinforce the resilience of 5G networks against evolving cyber/network threats.

## 2. Objective
The primary objective of this project is to significantly enhance the detection and response mechanisms against cyber threats in 5G networks. Our strategic approach includes rigorous threat assessments and the simulation of attack scenarios to pinpoint vulnerabilities effectively. These simulations will involve various denial-of-service (DoS) [3] attack vectors as part of our controlled testing environments. This will allow us to collect necessary information to identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).

A key aspect of our project is the commitment to high-precision documentation that details every step of the threat hunting process. This includes the analysis of simulated attacks and the identification of IoCs with the most realistic possible accuracy. Additionally, our documentation will capture the aspects of the network architecture and configurations that have proven resilient against attacks, thereby providing a dual perspective of vulnerability and robustness. Despite the project’s tight timelines, our documentation will strive to meet the highest standards of precision and relevance, ensuring that the deliverables not only enhance the security framework of 5G networks but also provide valuable insights to the cybersecurity community for ongoing threat mitigation strategies.
